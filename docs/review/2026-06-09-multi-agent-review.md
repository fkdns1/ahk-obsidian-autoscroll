# Multi-agent Review

Date: 2026-06-09
Scope: lightweight maintenance and open-source readiness review for this repository.

## Participants

- Maintenance/code hygiene reviewer: focused on concrete documentation defects, validation, source hygiene, and avoiding fake activity.
- Open-source/product readiness reviewer: focused on README clarity, license visibility, project narrative, issue surfaces, and release credibility.

## Discussion Summary

The reviewers agreed the immediate fix was the broken Quick Start script filename and license metadata. Product readiness also recommended making privacy scope clear, so the README now states that vault contents are not read or inspected.

Both reviewers rejected empty commits, generic issue spam, and adding GitHub Actions only to create activity. Manual AutoHotkey validation remains the right low-resource verification path for this small script.

## Decision

- Fix user-facing Quick Start documentation.
- Normalize MIT license metadata so GitHub can detect the license.
- Record the review outcome in WORKLOG.md and this review note.
- Leave runtime behavior unchanged.

## Verification

- AutoHotkey validation was run with no parser output.
- Changed-file privacy scan returned no matches for local path or credential patterns.
- GitHub license API reports MIT after the license text normalization.
## Security policy no-change follow-up

A security-scope reviewer and anti-churn reviewer evaluated whether this small AutoHotkey utility should receive a root SECURITY.md. Both recommended not adding copied per-repository security policy files because the script has no network service, dependency supply chain, package distribution, credential handling, or external input surface that would justify a heavier security process. The agreed threshold is to add a security policy later only if the project starts handling sensitive data, network/API calls, distributed binaries, or meaningful external issue traffic.
